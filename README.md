## Posting

If you are a member of Bellatrix Hadar (The ThickAether system) and are seeking
instructions on how to publish a post, first try asking internally. Bella,
Kanica, and Vrantis are the ones most likely to know. If they do not, are
unavailble, or you *are* one of those listed and have lost access to the
relevant information, see the [PROCEDURES.md](./PROCEDURES.md) file for
instructions.
