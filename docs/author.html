                    Well, now. Aren't you a curious one. Interested in that which we have yet to reveal of ourselves? Not
                    to worry, it will be answered in due time. Once this site launches in earnest all will be revealed,
                    or at least all of that which we are comfortable sharing. Try in a week or so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until then, ever curious peruser of this site.
