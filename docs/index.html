		<p><i>6:50AM local time, July 11th, 2023</i></p>
		<p>This is the personal blog. It clearly needs a facelift with a standard set
		of pages. I suppose you could consider this the very first post, and no doubt
		it will be converted to one when the time comes. A proper introduction shall
		come later; for now, I go by Bellatrix Hadar, or collectively The Thick Aether
		System. Both of these are in fact pseudonyms but publishing under a different
		name is a little bit easier; while our true names are not particularly a
		secret, we will not speak of them here.</p>
		<p>That is all for the moment. I hope to write again in the near future, on
		topics related to being a system and life after body age 30. Philosophy, musings
		on relationships, ponderings on fitting into society and making our way, that
		sort of thing.</p>
		<p>For now, I wish you a lovely day and hope that things go well for you.</p>
