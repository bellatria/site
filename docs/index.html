						<h1>Greetings</h1>
						<h4><time datetime="2023-07-11T11:50:22Z">6:50AM local time, July 11th, 2023</time></h4>

					<section>
						<p>This is the personal blog. It clearly needs a facelift with a standard set
						of pages. I suppose you could consider this the very first post, and no doubt
						it will be converted to one when the time comes. A proper introduction shall
						come later; for now, I go by Bellatrix Hadar, or collectively The Thick Aether
						System. Both of these are in fact pseudonyms but publishing under a different
						name makes things a bit easier for us to speak freely. While our true names
						are not particularly a secret, we will not speak of them here.</p>
						<p>That is all for the moment. I hope to write again in the near future, on
						topics related to being a plural system and life after body age 30. Philosophy,
						musings on relationships, ponderings on fitting into society and making our way,
						that sort of thing.</p>
						<p>For now, I wish you a lovely day and hope that things go well for you. As for
						myself, well. This black lipstick that is upon the body's lips grows faded and
						broken. In lieu of a proper stain, we shall be off to re-apply it.</p>
						<p>Stay mysterious and celebratory, dear friends.</p>

					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>
						Our party is called the ThickAether system, though in the world of singlets we go by the name of
						our singlet-sona, Bellatrix Hadar, taken from the name of a typical fronter, Bella. Our pronouns
						are she/her for us as a whole; individual members may have their own preferences. We are a
						plural system that started this site once we reached body age 30.
					</p>
					<p>
						We write on various topics of interest and glubbery in the areas of morality, philosophy,
						coping, and keeping life a party in a singlet-oriented world.
