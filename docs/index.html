			<section>
				<p>This is the personal blog. It clearly needs a facelift with a standard set
				of pages. I suppose you could consider this the very first post, and no doubt
				it will be converted to one when the time comes. A proper introduction shall
				come later; for now, I go by Bellatrix Hadar, or collectively The Thick Aether
				System. Both of these are in fact pseudonyms but publishing under a different
				name makes things a bit easier for us to speak freely. While our true names
				are not particularly a secret, we will not speak of them here.</p>
				<p>That is all for the moment. I hope to write again in the near future, on
				topics related to being a plural system and life after body age 30. Philosophy,
				musings on relationships, ponderings on fitting into society and making our way,
				that sort of thing.</p>
				<p>For now, I wish you a lovely day and hope that things go well for you. As for
				myself, well. This black lipstick that is upon the body's lips grows faded and
				broken. In lieu of a proper stain, we shall be off to re-apply it.</p>
				<p>Stay mysterious and celebratious, dear friends.</p>
