			<h1>Not Found</h1>
			<section>
				<p>
                    How unfortunate. That which you have requested could not be found. Perhaps you seek something which
					exists only in the great void, and sadly the entirety of said void cannot be reflected in the finite
					boundaries of a mere web page. Or perhaps you are looking for something which exists but which you
					have improperly typed into the address bar. 
                </p>
				<p>
					Should you have arrived here via a link within this website, you have our sincerest condolences as
					this represents an error on our part. In this case, feel free to open an <a href="https://github.com/bellatria/site/issues">Issue on GitHub,</a>
					if you are so inclined, but of course such a thing is not necessary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Regardless, for the moment what you seek cannot be found. Try going back and doing something else,
					perhaps. Until the next time you wish to probe the limits of existence, ever-curious peruser of this
					site.
                </p>
