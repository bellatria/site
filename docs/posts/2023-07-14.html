                        Good glubbin gog, the new site design is so much better. I won't say that we have a perfect eye
                        for design or anything of the sort, but at least the website is minimally functional. There is
                        now a color scheme! And reasonable presetentation of the content within! And other such things.
                        While I'm certainly a fan of keeping things simple, I do appreciate a nice dark theme. We used
                        <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/">AO3</a> and <a href="https://xeiaso.net/">Xe Iaso's
                        website</a> as points of reference for design and for using modern CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can't say that the website is accessible despite having done our best to do so; it is one of
                        the many things I hope we can improve in this place in the near future. We also need an RSS
                        feed or whatever technology is the favored one for syndication, and a comments system. As this
                        is a static website, comments will have to be external; we've got our eye on
                        <a href="https://chirpy.dev/">Chirpy</a> but truly only time will tell if that is what we will
                        eventually settle on. Right, and there's the Author/About page. Mmmm. Maybe we'll just stay
                        mysterious, who knows (we won't but don't quote me on that).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That aside, I wanted to take a moment to talk about a major happening in our life. We are moving
                        to a new residence, and we are pretty glubbin excited about it. We'll be moving from an
                        apartment where we've spent the better part of the last decade into a proper house. It is a
                        strange feeling, having actual ownership over the place we will live. We've been bouncing from
                        rented apartment to rented apartment ever since moving away from our parents at body age 18. I'm
                        so glubbin greatful we are able to actually afford a place; the days are long gone when everyone
                        could be expected to be able to do it, and it is by our lucky stars only that we can make it
                        this far.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ah, speaking of stars. The stars at the new place will be amazing, or so we hope at least. It
                        has a large yard with plenty of space to see the sky. The horizon is a bit dotted with a tree
                        line, but right in the middle will have a prefect view. Perhaps we'll build a tower or platform
                        there to see things better. Regardless, not living next to the city will, no doubt, make things
                        so much more clear.

                        On a more somber note, we've of course been doing a large portion of packing. While doing so, we
                        came across an old "box of memories" as we call it, a bin where we've placed birthday cards,
                        holiday cards, personal letters and hand-made gifts we simply cannot bring ourselves to throw
                        away over the years. We went through the box and found a difficult series of notes from a past
                        person, a significant other of times past. It detailed their falling for us and how much they
                        valued the time we had spent going out together and that they'd like to be together for a long
                        time to come.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We received this note in the same meeting that we broke up with them at, right after we did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The timing was unforutnate, but I cannot believe it was anybody's fault. Rather, they had simply
                        decided to give it to me on the same day that I had decided I wanted to deliver the news of
                        breaking up. But what soon followed after that was a long, long series of difficult and strained
                        relationships due to other poor choices I'd later make in life. As a result, we feel we have
                        wronged this person very badly and in a way we will never fix.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I came across a second letter from them, sent during the summer after the end of our
                        relationship. It was another handwritten note which detailed how they were getting along and how
                        they were so grateful for our time together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reading it filled us with regret at all we had done and the relatively recent total contact cut
                        off we had to initiate. It was for the best. The life we have chosen is incompatible with such
                        things. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't hope that they're still out there doing great
                        things. I hope that same thing for all persons whose thread of destiny wove across our own, for
                        however long it does. But my thread has split from theirs, and it must stay that way. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps one day I'll feel up to getting into all that happened. Rest assured I was not a good
                        person in the ways that I acted. Foolish and as a child learning to grow up. There are many
                        things that we can never forgive ourselves for, and though at the time this person and being
                        with them was not one of them, things have changed and it's impossible to view it in the same
                        light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What's done is done I suppose. All we can do is move forward, and sometimes we don't get the
                        privlege of fixing what we have broken. But what we can do is move forward and vow never to do
                        such things again, with the people who accept us as we are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How depressing this post has grown. The upside is that this move is exactly what we need. We
                        will leave many bad memories behind, including some associated with this person, and strike ever
                        forward in a new beginning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I cannot wait until that time arrives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Until next time,
